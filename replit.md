# Overview

This is a full-stack web application for Kitji Studios, a software development company, **now completely refactored to C# using Blazor WebAssembly and ASP.NET Core**. The application serves as a company portfolio website with contact form functionality, maintaining the exact same dark-themed UI and interactive features as the original React/TypeScript version. Its core purpose is to showcase Kitji Studios' capabilities in enterprise software development, with a focus on their flagship products Utell and Pelas, and services like WhatsApp Business Integration.

## Project Status: Hybrid Architecture Complete âœ…
